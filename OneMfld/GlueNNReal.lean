/-! # Gluing two charts into an `ℝ≥0`-valued chart

The shared assembly for the O-H and O-O (connected overlap) cases. Chart `a` is
normalized so its target is `Ioo 0 1` and the overlap image is the full lower
end-segment `Ioo 0 r`; chart `b` sees the overlap as an upper end-segment `Ioo q 1` of
its target. Pick a split value `μ ∈ Ioo q 1`, let `m := b.symm μ` be the split point and
`ρ := a m` its `a`-coordinate; glue `b` (kept as-is on the `b`-side `s`, where
`b ≤ μ`) with the rescaled chart `(μ/ρ) • a` (which agrees with `b` at `m`) using
`OpenPartialHomeomorph.piecewise` along `s := b.source ∩ b⁻¹' (Iic μ)`, `t := Iic μ`.
All the frontier conditions come from `IsImage.frontier` and `frontier_Iic`.

/-- **NNReal gluing.** Given charts `a` (target `Ioo 0 1`, overlap image the lower
end-segment `Ioo 0 r`) and `b` (target inside `Iio 1`, overlap image the upper
end-segment `Ioo q 1` with `q` interior), there is a chart on `a.source ∪ b.source`
whose target is `(b.target ∩ Iic μ) ∪ Ioo μ (μ/ρ)` for some split values
`q < μ < 1`, `0 < ρ < 1`. -/
