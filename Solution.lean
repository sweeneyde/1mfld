# Proved solution

This module imports the full proof development and restates the Challenge
theorem with the identical name and type. The library's `classification`
(in `OneMfld/Classification.lean`) produces the homeomorphism as data, as a
term of `(M ≃ₜ Circle) ⊕ (M ≃ₜ UnitInterval)`; here we only need the
Prop-level disjunction. The Challenge's `{x : ℝ // 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 1}` is
definitionally `↥OneMfld.UnitInterval` (and Mathlib's `↥unitInterval`).
